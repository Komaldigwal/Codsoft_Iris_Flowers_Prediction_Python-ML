# Codsoft_Iris_Flowers_Prediction_Python-ML

🌸 Iris Flower Classification – Machine Learning Project
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into one of three species — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements.

<br>
📌 Objectives
Analyze the relationship between flower features and species

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Train and compare ML models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

Visualize results for better understanding
